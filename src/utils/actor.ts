/**
 * `actorDefinitionCache` is process-wide, so a private Actor's definition must never be served from it to
 * anyone but its owner — else another token on the same process reads it with no auth check. Two invariants
 * keep this gate from inverting into a leak:
 *   1. `info.userId` is the platform-set OWNER, not the fetching token — so a non-owner's re-fetch can't
 *      overwrite the cached ownership.
 *   2. The caller is identified by `user('me')` under their own token (the same identity the platform
 *      authorizes with) and `null` is the sole non-identity sentinel — so a hit grants no more than a bare
 *      re-fetch would. Don't drop the `!== null` guard or swap in a cheaper identity source.
 *  Trade-off: an org-owned private Actor is cached under the org's userId, so an org member
 *  calling with a personal token never matches and re-fetches every time.
 *  Fail-safe (no leak), just uncached for members - accepted over an org-membership lookup
 *   that would put a per-call API round trip back on * this path.
