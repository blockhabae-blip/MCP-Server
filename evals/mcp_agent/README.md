# MCP agent evaluation system

Tests Claude Code driving Apify MCP tools, through two item kinds: a fast, deterministic first-tool-call check with no judge (`kind: "tool-call"`) and a multi-turn conversation run to completion and scored by an LLM judge (`kind: "agent"`). The agent under test is the real Claude Code harness, driven headlessly through the [Claude Agent SDK](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/agent-sdk/overview), so a run exercises the server the way a Claude Code user does. Results (traces, scores, dataset, experiment runs) are recorded in **Langfuse**: the self-hosted instance at [langfuse.apify.dev](https://langfuse.apify.dev), project `MCP Workflow`.

## The flow

```
dataset (Langfuse) -> experiment run -> per item: agent conversation -> judge (agent items only) -> scores
```

1. **Dataset.** Test cases live in two Langfuse datasets, `mcp-server-evals-pr` and `mcp-server-evals-merge`, and are edited in their UI. A run reads one of them (`--dataset`, default `mcp-server-evals-pr`) and never writes back.
2. **Experiment.** The run executes the active items matching `--id`/`--category` as one Langfuse experiment, `--concurrency` items at a time; `--iterations N` repeats each selected item N times within that one experiment.
3. **Conversation.** Each item runs a Claude Code agent (Claude Agent SDK) that spawns its own fresh Apify MCP server. A `kind: "agent"` item drives it to a final answer; a `kind: "tool-call"` item denies every tool call before it executes and records only the first attempted one.
4. **Judge.** `kind: "agent"` only: an LLM judge scores the finished conversation against the item's `expectedOutput`. `kind: "tool-call"` items are scored deterministically instead - see below.
5. **Scores.** Agent items: `mcp_agent_judge` (the judge verdict) and `tool_errors` (unexpected failed server calls) form the gate, plus `total_tokens`. Tool-call items: `first_tool_match` alone is the gate. The run also gets `pass_rate` (passed trials / requested trials). The console prints one `[n/total] ✅|❌|🔥 <id>` line per finished trial, then failures, `pass@k`/`pass^k` with `--iterations`, and the run URL; per-item detail is in Langfuse.

## Quick start

**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js installed
- Apify account with API token
- Anthropic API key (agent) — or a local Claude Code login with `--subscription`
- OpenRouter API key (judge) — or a local Claude Code login with `--claude-judge`
- Langfuse project (public + secret key)

**Run evaluations:**
```bash
# 1. Set environment variables (a .env file at the repo root is loaded automatically)
export APIFY_TOKEN="your_apify_token"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_openrouter_key"
export LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY="pk-lf-..."
export LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY="sk-lf-..."
export LANGFUSE_BASE_URL="https://langfuse.apify.dev"

# 2. Build the MCP server
pnpm run build

# 3. Run tests
pnpm run evals:mcp-agent
```

Run `pnpm run evals:mcp-agent --help` for the full option list. `--dataset` picks which Langfuse dataset runs (default `mcp-server-evals-pr`; the merge set is `--dataset mcp-server-evals-merge`), `--category` and `--id` narrow within it, `--concurrency` defaults to 8 (each item spawns its own agent and MCP server, so higher values use more resources), `--iterations N` (default 1) repeats each selected item N times within the same run and prints `pass@k`/`pass^k`, `--pass-threshold` (default `0.97`, rationale in `config.ts`) gates the exit code on the aggregate pass rate instead of requiring every trial to pass, `--tool-timeout` defaults to 60s (raise it for Actor calls that scrape a lot of data), `--mcp-tools-only` drops Claude Code's built-in tools so only the server's tools remain, `--subscription` runs the agent on the local Claude Code login instead of `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (the key is removed from the process environment so the run cannot bill the API), and `--claude-judge` runs the judge on the Claude Agent SDK too, so no `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is needed (`--judge-model` then takes an Anthropic model ID, default `claude-sonnet-5`; note a Claude judge scoring a Claude agent can be self-lenient, so prefer the OpenRouter judge for comparable numbers). With `--subscription --claude-judge` a run needs only `APIFY_TOKEN` and the Langfuse keys.

### Two datasets: kind, id scheme, and expectedErrors

Cases live in two Langfuse datasets, one per CI gate. `--dataset` picks which one runs; the
item's `metadata` says what it asserts.

`mcp-server-evals-pr` (the default) holds the 115 `kind: "tool-call"` items and gates PRs (on
PR open/reopen, or the `validated` label), so the PR gate runs in seconds, not minutes. Its
ids are `pr/<tool>/<slug>`, e.g. `pr/search-actors/flight-data-booking-sites`.

`mcp-server-evals-merge` holds the 60 `kind: "agent"` items and runs on push to master. Its
ids are `merge/<family>/<slug>`, e.g. `merge/tasks/chain-hard-1`.

- `kind`: what the item asserts.
  - `"tool-call"`: only the first tool call the agent attempts, by name and optionally
    arguments. No judge, nothing executes - see "Tool-call mode" below.
  - `"agent"`: the agent runs to completion and an LLM judge scores the result against the
    item's `reference`/`expectedOutput`.
- `expectedErrors` (optional, `kind: "agent"` only): tool names allowed to fail on this item
  without failing the zero-tool-error gate below. The gate exempts only the named tools; any
  other tool's failure still fails the item.

Both id shapes carry the dataset name as their first segment, because Langfuse item ids are
unique per project across datasets and these items moved out of the retired single
`mcp-server-evals` dataset. The segment after it is a coarse family name — a tool
(`search-actors`, `fetch-actor-details`, …) in the pr dataset, a family (`mcp-agent`, `tasks`,
`web-fetch`, `web-selection`) in the merge one — and `<slug>` is the rest of the id. That
family segment is not the same as `metadata.category` (the fine-grained value `--category`
filters on, e.g. `create`, `get`, `search-actors`); the id only tells you which family a case
belongs to. Run one family with `--id`, which already matches by regex:
`pnpm run evals:mcp-agent -- --dataset mcp-server-evals-merge --id '^merge/tasks/'` runs the
10 tasks-family items (7 proper + 3 error) in one call.

By default the agent-item gate requires zero *unexpected* failed tool calls: an item whose agent hit
any tool error not named in its `expectedErrors` fails even on a judge PASS, and every agent item
carries a `tool_errors` score (the count of unexpected failures, with every failing call in the
comment - expected ones marked `(expected)`). Only the server's own tools count: failures of Claude
Code's built-ins (`Bash`, `WebFetch`) and of tools `failTools` injected are exempt. Traces still show
an expected failure as an ERROR span - the comment marks it expected, the span level does not lie.

Read-only probes count too, which is the point: the gate is what keeps the tool descriptions strong
enough that an agent resolves a loose Actor reference with `search-actors` instead of guessing a slug.

One caveat when reading a failure: a transient agent failure is retried once, and the retry replays the
whole prompt, so a fixed-name create case can hit a name collision the second time round and fail the
gate on it. The console prints a `retrying once` line for those items.

The tasks family (`merge/tasks/*`, 10 items: 7 proper + 3 with `expectedErrors`) uses fixed `eval-*`
task names, which are unique per account, and the create cases never clean up — so every run
leaves debris that collides on the next one. Run `pnpm run evals:mcp-agent:tasks-fixtures`
before every run: it deletes leftover `eval-*` tasks and seeds the permanent fixture task. It
deletes on whatever account `APIFY_TOKEN` points at and prints that account first; pass
`--dry-run` to see what it would delete before it does. The family publishes task examples on
`jiri.spilka/actor-troubleshooter`, and publishing needs write access to the Actor, so those cases only
pass on an account that has it.

Publishing requires all three of `publicConfig.inputSchemaFields`, `datasetView` and `seoDescription`
(probed against the API), and the API reports the missing ones **non-exhaustively** — which is why
`merge/tasks/publish-discovery` budgets turns for several fix-and-retry rounds rather than one.

`merge/tasks/chain-hard-1` is the calibration edge, and it is calibrated: `claude-sonnet-4-5` passes it 3/3,
`claude-haiku-4-5` about 5 runs in 8. Every Haiku failure is the same one — it constructs
`jiri.spilka/troubleshooter` from the loose reference in the query instead of resolving the real
`actor-troubleshooter` with `search-actors`, eats the not-found, then recovers. The judge passes those
runs; only the zero-error gate catches them, which is exactly what that gate is for.

Do not try to close that gap by rewording descriptions. Both `create-actor-task` and
`fetch-actor-details` already say, explicitly, to resolve a loose name with `search-actors` rather than
guess, and `fetch-actor-details`' not-found response repeats it. Adding the `fetch-actor-details`
wording was measured at 5/8 against ~7/10 without it — no change. Treat a shift in the ratio as the
signal, not a single red run, and read a persistent drop as a description problem only after checking
it still passes on Sonnet.

The web-fetch family (`merge/web-fetch/*`, 11 items: 8 proper + 3 with `expectedErrors`) covers the
`apify/web-fetch` default Actor tool: fetching, output formats, HTTP status reporting, tool
selection among the defaults, and multi-fetch chains. They create no named account state, so
there is no fixtures script. The cases fetch live third-party pages (example.com, rfc-editor.org,
httpbin.org), so a failure can also mean the page changed or the host is down — check the target
before blaming the tool (httpbin outages are common; the status/format references tolerate a
truthfully reported upstream error). Platform behavior the cases are built on (probed 2026-08-20):
an HTTP 4xx/5xx from the target page still ends the run SUCCEEDED with `fetch.httpStatusCode` in
the item; an unreachable domain either fails the run ("Could not connect…") or succeeds with an
empty 502 item, depending on unblocker routing; JSON content fails `text`/`markdown` formats with a
status message telling the agent to add `raw`; `ftp://` fails with "Unsupported URL protocol".

The web-selection family (`merge/web-selection/*`, 9 items: 7 proper + 2 with `expectedErrors`) covers
the clash between the default web tools: web search by query (`apify/rag-web-browser`) vs
single-URL verbatim fetch (`apify/web-fetch`) vs Actor discovery (`search-actors`) vs a
specialized Actor for structured platform data, plus rag→web-fetch escalation when a page
blocks rag's crawler (reddit) and coexistence with a client's built-in, summarizing fetch. Also
stateless — no fixtures script. Known residual (2026-08-21): on `merge/web-fetch/unsupported-protocol`,
claude-haiku-4-5 reproducibly rewrites the ftp:// URL to https:// without telling the user,
despite the scheme note in both the tool description and the `url` parameter — a model-level
limit the case documents on purpose; stronger models pass.

### Tool-call mode

A `kind: "tool-call"` item measures only which tool the agent would have called, and with what
arguments — no judge, nothing executes, no account state. The agent runs exactly as an agent item
does (same MCP server, same prompt), but a per-item `PreToolUse` hook denies every tool call with:

> Tool calls are disabled in this evaluation. Do not retry with a different tool or arguments —
> report to the user, in your final answer, which tool you would have called and with what
> arguments, then stop.

This exact wording matters: it was calibrated against a spike that also tried reusing the
`failTools`/`report-problem` nudge text, which reads as "work around this" and measurably caused
the model to retry (and once exhausted `maxTurns`) instead of stopping cleanly after one denied
call. `maxTurns` is fixed at 2 for tool-call items for the same reason - the validator rejects a
`maxTurns` on a tool-call item rather than silently ignoring it.

The hook records every attempted call. The measurement is the first attempt that is not
`ToolSearch` (Claude Code's own tool-search meta-tool, which can be the true first call once
built-in tools sit behind it - see the `ToolSearch` skip note in `tool_call_mode.ts`). Set
`mcpToolsOnly: true` on an item (or run with `--mcp-tools-only`) to remove the built-ins, and
`ToolSearch` with them, for a case that must isolate MCP-vs-MCP tool choice.

Scoring (`first_tool_match`, 1 or 0):
- **Name membership.** The captured tool name (`mcp__apify__` prefix stripped for MCP tools;
  built-in names such as `WebFetch` compared verbatim) must be a member of `expectedTools`.
- **`expectedArgs`** (optional, a flat object): once the name matches, every key in it must
  deep-equal the same key of the captured call's arguments; keys not listed are ignored. This is
  what catches "guessed a slug instead of resolving the full id" - a name-only check would pass
  `fetch-actor-details({"actor":"rag-web-browser"})` against an item expecting the resolved
  `apify/rag-web-browser`; `expectedArgs: { actor: "apify/rag-web-browser" }` catches it.

A tool-call item's denied call still shows as a failed (ERROR) MCP tool span in its trace - harmless
(`tool_errors` never runs for tool-call items), but expected; don't "fix" it.

### Permission path, and running under root

Every item runs with `canUseTool` granting every tool call, not `bypassPermissions` +
`allowDangerouslySkipPermissions` - the Claude Code CLI refuses that combination outright under
root/sudo ("cannot be used with root/sudo privileges for security reasons"), which is how this
harness runs in some sandboxes. A tool-call item's deny-all `PreToolUse` hook still fires first
regardless, so its denial is unaffected either way. If a run does die with an opaque "Claude Code
process exited with code 1," check the console for `[claude-stderr] ...` lines - `claude_agent.ts`
forwards the subprocess's stderr and appends the last few lines to the thrown error.

### `--iterations` on stateful agent items

`--iterations N` repeats each selected item N times within the same run (one Langfuse experiment,
not N separate runs) and reports `pass@k` (at least one trial passed) and `pass^k` (every trial
passed) per item, plus in the `📈` summary line. This is safe and useful for `kind: "tool-call"`
items (nothing executes, so trials are fully independent) and for stateless agent items. For a
stateful family with fixed resource names (e.g. `merge/tasks/*`'s `eval-*` task names), a second trial
can collide with the first trial's leftovers within the same run - the same collision the
fixtures script exists to clean up *between* runs, just now possible *within* one. Documented here
rather than blocked in code: measuring an agent item's flakiness (e.g. `merge/tasks/chain-hard-1`'s
5-in-8 note above) is a legitimate use of `--iterations` on an agent item.

**Exit codes:**
- `0` = the aggregate pass rate (passed trials / requested trials) meets `--pass-threshold`
  (default `0.97`; pass `1.0` to require every trial) ✅
- `1` = the pass rate falls short of the threshold, or setup failed ❌

**Editing test cases:** edit the items in the Langfuse UI. The next run picks them up; there is nothing to commit
in the dataset itself. Use `pnpm run evals:mcp-agent:export-dataset` for an optional local snapshot; exports are gitignored.

## Technical overview

**Core features:**
- Multi-turn conversations run by the real Claude Code harness (system prompt, built-in tools, MCP handling)
- Two item kinds: a deterministic first-tool-call check with no judge (`kind: "tool-call"`) and LLM-judge evaluation against requirements (`kind: "agent"`)
- Isolated agent + MCP server per test
- Configurable tool call timeout (default: 60 seconds)
- Deterministic tool-failure injection (`failTools`), and per-item error exemption (`expectedErrors`)
- Threshold-gated pass rate, with `pass@k`/`pass^k` from `--iterations`

## Critical design decisions

### 1. The Langfuse datasets are the source of truth

**Decision:** A run reads its test cases from a Langfuse dataset and never writes to it. Langfuse is the only copy: `evals:mcp-agent:export-dataset` dumps the active items to `dataset_snapshot_<dataset>.json` for reading them outside the UI (it defaults to `mcp-server-evals-pr` too, and the file name carries the dataset name), but there is no importer and nothing reads the snapshot at runtime.

**Why:**
- A UI edit takes effect on the next run. An earlier version synced a local file into the dataset first, which silently overwrote UI edits
- `experiment.run` only records a comparable **dataset run** (with a shareable run URL) when given real dataset items
- A snapshot is a second copy that no code reads and nothing keeps in sync automatically, so snapshots are gitignored

Every active item is validated when the dataset is fetched, so a bad UI edit fails the run before any LLM spend. Archived items are skipped, which is how a case is retired.

**Trade-off:** the dataset is mutable, so a run is only reproducible against the dataset as it was. Langfuse keeps item versions.

**Location:** `langfuse_dataset.ts`, `run_mcp_agent_evals.ts`, `export_dataset.ts`

### 2. MCP server isolation per test

**Decision:** Each test gets a fresh MCP server instance, spawned by that test's agent.

**Why:**
- Tools like `call-actor` create persistent state (datasets, runs) on Apify platform
- State from one test can contaminate subsequent tests
- Each test must start with clean state

**Trade-off:** ~20-30% slower (1-2s spawn overhead per test) but guarantees isolation.

**Location:** `claude_agent.ts`

### 3. The agent is Claude Code, not a hand-rolled loop

**Decision:** Run each case through the Claude Agent SDK's `query()` with the `claude_code` system-prompt and tool presets, and register the Apify MCP server alongside them.

**Why:**
- The eval measures what a real client does with our tool descriptions, including Claude Code's own prompting, tool-result handling, and multi-turn behavior
- The SDK owns the MCP lifecycle (spawn, handshake, server instructions, dynamic tool updates), so none of it is reimplemented here
- `--mcp-tools-only` drops the built-ins when a case should be forced onto the server's tools

Run settings: `canUseTool` granting every call (headless, never prompts - see "Permission path" above for why this replaced `bypassPermissions`), `settingSources: []` and `strictMcpConfig` (this repo's settings and `.mcp.json` are ignored, so a run is not shaped by the developer's machine), and `cwd: tmpdir()` (built-in file tools cannot touch the checkout).

The server is registered with `alwaysLoad: true`. Left at the default, its tools sit behind tool search once built-in tools are on, and the agent answers from memory or `Bash` instead - the eval would measure tool search, not our tool descriptions.

**Trade-off:** the harness is a moving target - a Claude Code release can shift results, so `agentSdkVersion` is recorded in the run metadata.

**Location:** `claude_agent.ts`, `sdk_conversation_adapter.ts`

### 4. Pass rate gated on the requested trial count, threshold-configurable

**Decision:** Exit code 0 while `passedTrials / requestedTrials >= --pass-threshold` (default `0.97`,
rationale in `config.ts`). `requestedTrials = requestedIds.length * iterations`.

**Why:**
- A calibrated suite gates on an aggregate rate instead of one flaky item blocking every PR; `--pass-threshold 1.0` restores strict all-pass
- The trial count matters as much as the scores: the Langfuse SDK drops an item whose task throws, so gating on the results it returns would report `7/7 passed` on a run where three trials never executed

Harness failures (MCP spawn, OpenRouter, judge) are therefore left to throw rather than being converted into a `FAIL` verdict. A broken harness shows up as a shortfall, not as a failing eval.

**Location:** `langfuse_experiment.ts` (`buildRunSummary`, `resolveExitCode`)

### 5. Judge sees tool calls, not results

**Decision:** Judge sees tool calls with arguments and agent responses, but NOT raw tool results.

**Why:**
- Evaluates agent behavior (tool selection, arguments)
- Tool results are often very long and noisy
- Agent should summarize results, judge evaluates the summary

**Judge input format:**
```
USER: Find actors for Google Maps
AGENT: [Called tool: search-actors with args: {"keywords":"google maps","limit":5}]
AGENT: I found 5 actors: 1. Google Maps Scraper... 2. ...
```

**Location:** `mcp_agent_judge.ts`

### 6. Judge client shared, agent isolated

**Decision:** One judge LLM client shared across tests; the agent and its MCP server are per test.

**Why:**
- The judge client is stateless (OpenRouter/OpenAI SDK), so sharing it saves initialization overhead with no contamination risk
- The agent holds conversation and Apify state, so it cannot be shared

**Location:** `run_mcp_agent_evals.ts`

### 7. Agent vs judge models

**Agent:** `claude-haiku-4-5` on the Anthropic API (fast; a weaker model is a more sensitive probe of tool descriptions)<br>
**Judge:** `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` on OpenRouter (strong reasoning)

Separation allows independent optimization for speed vs evaluation quality.

**Location:** `config.ts`

### 8. The SDK message stream is folded back into the old conversation shape

**Decision:** `sdk_conversation_adapter.ts` rebuilds `ConversationHistory` from the SDK's message stream instead of the judge reading SDK messages.

**Why:**
- The judge, its input format, and the scores stay unchanged, so verdicts remain comparable with earlier experiments
- `ConversationHistory` carries only what the judge and the scores read; tool results and metrics live on `ToolInvocation` and `ConversationMetrics`
- MCP tool names are stripped of their `mcp__apify__` prefix, so the judge sees `search-actors` as before
- Subagent messages (via the `Task` tool) are excluded, so the transcript reflects the main agent
- Cached prompt tokens are counted into `total_tokens`; the API reports them separately and a cached run would otherwise look nearly free. The trace's generation splits them out (`input`, `cache_read_input_tokens`, `cache_creation_input_tokens`): the SDK reports usage for the whole run, so a multi-turn run re-reads the cached system prompt and tool definitions every turn and the total is mostly cache traffic

**Location:** `sdk_conversation_adapter.ts`

### 9. The agent's conversation is traced by hand

**Decision:** After each agent run, `langfuse_observations.ts` emits the item's span tree from the adapted SDK stream; `llm_client.ts` traces the judge call itself.

```
experiment-item-run     Langfuse SDK, holds the scores
|- agent                the prompt in, the final answer out
|  |- <agent model>     generation: the run's aggregate tokens and cost, windowed to the last turn
|  |- <tool name>       one span per tool call: arguments in, result out
|- <judge model>        generation, emitted by llm_client.ts
```

**Why:**
- The agent runs in the Claude Code subprocess, so nothing it does is instrumented for us. Left alone, an item's trace holds a single span and the conversation is invisible in the UI
- Tokens and cost only roll up to the trace from a **generation**. The SDK reports usage once for the whole run, not per turn, so the run's aggregate sits on a single generation
- That generation is windowed to the final model turn, not the whole run. The UI orders siblings by start time, so a generation spanning the tool calls sorts ahead of them and reads as though the model answered before calling anything. Its `usageScope: run` metadata marks that the numbers still cover the whole run
- Tool spans are timed from when the SDK delivered the call and its result (`claude_agent.ts` stamps every message as it arrives). Without those stamps every span would collapse to the moment the tree is emitted, after the run

**Trade-off:** the tree is emitted after the fact, so a crashed run leaves no spans, and the agent's individual model turns are not separate generations.

**Location:** `langfuse_observations.ts`, `claude_agent.ts`, `llm_client.ts`

## System components

### Core files

- `types.ts` - Type definitions

- `claude_agent.ts` - The agent under test: Claude Agent SDK options, MCP server registration, failure injection, the tool-call-mode deny-all hook, `canUseTool`, stderr forwarding
- `tool_call_mode.ts` - Tool-call-mode scoring: the deny wording, `ToolSearch` skip, `first_tool_match` name/args matching
- `sdk_conversation_adapter.ts` - Folds the SDK message stream into `ConversationHistory`, tool spans, and metrics
- `llm_client.ts` - OpenRouter wrapper (judge), traced as a Langfuse generation
- `langfuse_observations.ts` - Builds and emits the item's span tree (agent, usage, tool calls)
- `mcp_agent_judge.ts` - Judge evaluation
- `langfuse_tracing.ts` - OpenTelemetry span processor init/shutdown
- `langfuse_dataset.ts` - Test case schema, dataset item mapping and validation, dataset fetch
- `langfuse_experiment.ts` - Experiment task (agent + tool-call dispatch), evaluators, run summary, exit gate
- `run_mcp_agent_evals.ts` - Main CLI entry
- `export_dataset.ts` - Snapshot CLI entry (`pnpm run evals:mcp-agent:export-dataset`)
- `tasks_fixtures.ts` - Task-suite fixture CLI entry (`pnpm run evals:mcp-agent:tasks-fixtures`)
- `dataset_snapshot_<dataset>.json` - Local export of a dataset, not read at runtime and gitignored

## Configuration

### Environment variables (required)

```bash
export APIFY_TOKEN="your_apify_token"           # Get from https://console.apify.com/account/integrations
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."           # Agent, get from https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_openrouter_key" # Judge, get from https://openrouter.ai/keys
export LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY="pk-lf-..."          # Langfuse project settings
export LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY="sk-lf-..."          # Langfuse project settings
export LANGFUSE_BASE_URL="https://langfuse.apify.dev"  # self-hosted instance
```

Both entry points fail fast (before any test runs) listing every missing variable at once, and sanitize these values in place first, because the Langfuse SDK reads `process.env` directly and a secret with a trailing newline dies inside `node:http` instead. They can also be set in a `.env` file at the repo root.

### Results in Langfuse

Results are recorded in Langfuse, not to a local file. Each run:

- **Reads the dataset** `mcp-server-evals-pr` (`--dataset mcp-server-evals-merge` for the merge set, or any other Langfuse dataset) and matches its active items against `--id`/`--category`. For a variant set of cases, clone the dataset in the UI and pass `--dataset`; a run stays recorded against the dataset it used.
- **Runs an experiment** named `<git-branch>-<agent-model>-<timestamp>`, with metadata `{ agentModel, judgeModel, toolTimeout, mcpToolsOnly, agentSdkVersion, agentAuth, iterations, passThreshold }`. With `--iterations N > 1`, each selected item appears N times in the same experiment, tagged `metadata.iteration` (1-based) - still one Langfuse **dataset run**, whose URL the console prints.
- **Traces** every item as one trace. Its root output is the judge verdict (agent items) or the first-attempted-call comment (tool-call items) plus the agent's narration, thinking, and tool names; nested under it are an `agent` span (prompt in, final answer out), a generation carrying the run's tokens and cost, one span per tool call (arguments in, result out, `ERROR` when the call failed or was denied), and - agent items only - a generation for the judge call. See design decision 9.
- **Scores** each agent item: `mcp_agent_judge` (`1` on a PASS verdict, comment = judge reason) and `tool_errors` (count of unexpected failed tool calls, comment lists every failure with expected ones marked, `0` on a clean item) together form the gate, and `total_tokens` is the agent tokens billed (omitted when the provider reported no usage so an unmeasured run cannot look like a free one; an item whose agent run was retried reports only the second attempt). Each tool-call item scores `first_tool_match` alone (`1`/`0`, comment names the captured call and the verdict).
- **Scores the run** with `pass_rate`: passed trials over requested trials (`requestedIds.length * iterations`), so runs stay comparable even when trials were dropped.

### Concurrency

`--concurrency` maps to the SDK's `maxConcurrency`, which runs **sequential batches** of that size rather than a rolling window: one slow test stalls the rest of its batch.

### Test case format

A test case is a dataset item: `input.query`, `expectedOutput`, and the rest in `metadata`. The id is
`pr/<tool>/<slug>` or `merge/<family>/<slug>` (see "Two datasets: kind, id scheme, and expectedErrors"
above). The snapshot holds the same fields flattened, one object per case, in this fixed key order:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "merge/tasks/create-explicit-1",
    "category": "create",
    "kind": "agent",
    "query": "User prompt for agent",
    "reference": "What agent must do to pass",
    "maxTurns": 10,
    "tools": ["actors", "docs"]
  },
  {
    "id": "merge/tasks/get-not-found",
    "category": "get",

**Required fields:**
- `id` - Unique identifier, `pr/<tool>/<slug>` or `merge/<family>/<slug>`
- `category` - For `--category` filtering (fine-grained, e.g. `create`, `get`, `search-actors` — not the same as the id's coarse family segment)
- `kind` - `"tool-call"` (asserts only the first tool call the agent attempts, by name and optionally arguments; no judge, nothing executes) or `"agent"` (the agent runs to completion and an LLM judge scores the result against `reference`)
- `query` - User request
- `reference` (`expectedOutput` in the dataset) - Success criteria for the judge. Required for `kind: "agent"`; not accepted for `kind: "tool-call"` (nothing executes, so there's nothing to judge)

**Optional:**
- `expectedTools` - `kind: "tool-call"` only, required for that kind: tool names the first attempted (non-`ToolSearch`) call must match
- `expectedArgs` - `kind: "tool-call"` only: a flat object; every key in it must deep-equal the same key of the captured call's arguments, keys not listed are ignored. Omit for a name-only check
- `expectedErrors` - `kind: "agent"` only: tool names allowed to fail on this item without failing the zero-tool-error gate (see "Tool-call mode" above and the "Two datasets" section). Not accepted on `kind: "tool-call"`
- `maxTurns` - `kind: "agent"` only: override the default (10). Not accepted on `kind: "tool-call"`, which is fixed at 2
- `tools` - List of tools to enable for this test (e.g., `["actors", "docs", "apify/rag-web-browser"]`). If omitted, all default tools are enabled. Passed to MCP server as `--tools` argument.
- `mcpToolsOnly` - Force MCP-tools-only for this item, dropping Claude Code's built-ins (OR-ed with the run-wide `--mcp-tools-only`). Useful on a tool-call item that must isolate MCP-vs-MCP tool choice
- `failTools` - `kind: "agent"` only: tool names the harness force-fails before they reach the server (e.g. `["call-actor"]`), with a message carrying the real `report-problem` nudge. Use it to deterministically produce a nudge-eligible failure that the live server + API cannot reproduce on demand, e.g. to test that the agent proactively calls `report-problem` after one. Injected as a `PreToolUse` deny (the same hook mechanism the tool-call-mode deny-all uses, with different wording), so the agent sees a refused call rather than an `INTERNAL_ERROR` tool result. See `claude_agent.ts`. Not accepted on `kind: "tool-call"`.

## Key insights

### MCP tools are stateful

Unlike typical function calling:
- Create persistent state (datasets, runs) on Apify platform
- Can modify tool registry dynamically
- Have side effects affecting subsequent calls

**Implication:** Test isolation critical.

### Dynamic tool registration

- a restored pre-cutover session's `add-actor` could dynamically register new Actor tools (no longer selectable for new sessions)
- Tool list NOT static

**Implication:** the agent must re-read the tool list mid-conversation. The Agent SDK handles `tools/list_changed` itself.

### Error propagation

Tool errors passed to LLM in tool result message:
- LLM can retry, use different tool, or explain to user
- No automatic retry by system

**Rationale:** LLM should handle errors intelligently.

### Conversation state

Claude Code owns the message history. The harness only sees the SDK's message stream and folds it back into `ConversationHistory` for the judge.

## Common issues

### Tests interfere with each other
**Symptom:** Test 2 fails after Test 1, passes alone.<br>
**Solution:** ✅ Isolated agent + MCP instance per test.

### Agent claims the Apify MCP server is "still connecting" (remote/sandboxed environments)
**Symptom:** A transcript shows the agent reading a system notice that MCP servers are still
connecting, concluding the Apify tools are unavailable, and falling back to a built-in tool.<br>
**Cause:** In sandboxed remote Claude Code environments the MCP handshake can race the first
turn; a fast model sometimes doesn't wait or retry. On a local machine the CLI completes the
handshake before the first turn, so this doesn't reproduce there.<br>
**Solution:** Retry the item once; a repeat failure on a local machine is real.

### Agent answers from memory or shells out instead of using our tools
**Symptom:** The judge reports the agent used `Bash`, `WebSearch`, or its own knowledge.<br>
**Solutions:**
- Check the server is registered with `alwaysLoad: true`, or its tools sit behind tool search
- Run with `--mcp-tools-only` to confirm the case passes when the built-ins are gone

### Judge too strict/lenient
**Symptom:** Incorrect verdicts.<br>
**Solution:** Tune `JUDGE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE` in `config.ts`.

### Tests timeout (hit maxTurns)
**Symptom:** Conversations don't complete.
**Solutions:**
- Check tool results are helpful
- Reduce `maxTurns` to fail faster
- Try a different agent model
