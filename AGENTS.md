# Apify MCP server development instructions

## Overview

This is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes [Apify Actors](https://apify.com/store) as tools.
It enables AI assistants to discover and use thousands of web scraping and automation tools from the Apify Store.

The codebase is built with TypeScript using ES modules and follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns.

The server can run in multiple modes:
- **Standard Input/Output (stdio)**: For local integrations and command-line tools like Claude Desktop
- **HTTP Streamable**: For hosted deployments and web-based MCP clients
- **Legacy SSE over HTTP**: Legacy version of the protocol for hosted deployments and web-based clients (deprecated and will be removed in the future)

### Key concepts

- **MCP**: Model Context Protocol defines tools, resources, and prompts that AI agents can use
- **Apify Actors**: Reusable automation tools (web scrapers, data extractors) available on Apify Store
- **Tool discovery**: Actors are dynamically converted to MCP tools based on their input schemas

### Core Philosophy

- Simple is better than complex
- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's (usually) a bad idea.
- **Ruthlessly minimal**: Only implement what's explicitly in scope
- **Lightweight**: Measure complexity by lines of code, not abstractions
- **No over-engineering**: Solve the current problem, not hypothetical future ones
- **No unsolicited features**: Don't add anything not explicitly requested by human operator

### Root directories
- `src/`: Main TypeScript source code
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests
- `dist/`: Compiled JavaScript output (generated during build)
- `evals/`: Evaluation scripts and test cases for AI agent interactions
- `res/`: Resources directory containing technical documentation, insights, and analysis about complex subsystems (see [res/INDEX.md](./res/INDEX.md))

### Core architecture (`src/` directory)

The codebase is organized into logical modules:

- `src/mcp/` - Core MCP protocol implementation
- `src/tools/` - MCP tool implementations
- `src/utils/` - Shared utility modules
- `src/actor/` - Actor-specific implementation (for Apify platform deployment) (only used for testing)

- Entry points:
  - `src/index.ts` - Main library export (`ActorsMcpServer` class)
  - `src/index-internals.ts` - Internal exports for testing and advanced usage
  - `src/stdio.ts` - Standard input/output entry point (CLI, used for Docker)
  - `src/main.ts` - Actor entry point (for Apify platform)
  - `src/input.ts` - Input processing and validation

## ⚠️ MANDATORY: Verification after every implementation

**THIS IS NON-NEGOTIABLE. DO NOT SKIP.**

After completing ANY code change (feature, fix, refactor), you MUST:

1. **Type check**: `npm run type-check`
   - Fix ALL TypeScript errors before proceeding
   - Zero tolerance for type errors

2. **Lint**: `npm run lint`
   - Fix ALL lint errors before proceeding
   - Use `npm run lint:fix` for auto-fixable issues

3. **Unit tests**: `npm run test:unit`
   - ALL tests must pass
   - If a test fails, fix it before moving on

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Do NOT use `npm run build` for routine code verification.** Always use `npm run type-check` instead — it is faster and sufficient for validating TypeScript correctness. Only run `npm run build` when you explicitly need compiled JavaScript output (e.g., before integration tests or deployment).

**When to run verification:**
- After implementing a feature
- After fixing a bug
- After any refactor
- Before marking any task as complete

**What to do if verification fails:**
1. DO NOT proceed to the next task
2. Fix the issue immediately
3. Re-run verification until green
4. Only then continue

### Quick validation workflow

**When to use `type-check` only:**
- When you just want to verify TypeScript compilation without updating `dist/`
- For quick validation during development iterations
- When reviewing code changes before committing
- Faster than `build` since it skips JavaScript output generation

**When to use `build`:**
- Before running integration tests (they require compiled JavaScript in `dist/`)
- When you need the compiled output for testing or deployment

## Testing

### Running tests

- **Unit tests**: `npm run test:unit` (runs `vitest run tests/unit`)
- **Integration tests**: `npm run test:integration` (requires build first, requires `APIFY_TOKEN`)

### Important: Integration tests require APIFY_TOKEN

**⚠️ DO NOT attempt to run integration tests as an agent.** Integration tests require a valid `APIFY_TOKEN` environment variable, which only humans have access to. As an agent, you should:
- Run `npm run type-check` to validate TypeScript changes (do NOT use `npm run build` for this)
- Run `npm run test:unit` for unit tests which don't require authentication
- Skip integration tests - these must be run by humans with valid Apify credentials

### Test structure

- `tests/unit/` - Unit tests for individual modules
- `tests/integration/` - Integration tests for MCP server functionality
  - `tests/integration/suite.ts` - **Main integration test suite** where all test cases should be added
  - Other files in this directory set up different transport modes (stdio, SSE, streamable-http) that all use suite.ts
- `tests/helpers.ts` - Shared test utilities
- `tests/const.ts` - Test constants

### Test guidelines

- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Follow existing test patterns in the codebase
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a PR

### Adding integration tests

**IMPORTANT**: When adding integration test cases, add them to `tests/integration/suite.ts`, NOT as separate test files.

The `suite.ts` file contains a test suite factory function `createIntegrationTestsSuite()` that is used by all transport modes (stdio, SSE, streamable-http). Adding tests here ensures they run across all transport types.

**How to add a test case:**
1. Open `tests/integration/suite.ts`
2. Add your test case inside the `describe` block (before the closing braces at the end)
3. Use `it()` or `it.runIf()` for conditional tests
4. Follow the existing patterns for client creation and assertions
5. Use `client = await createClientFn(options)` to create the test client
6. Always call `await client.close()` when done

**Example:**
```typescript
it('should do something awesome', async () => {
    client = await createClientFn({ tools: ['actors'] });
    const result = await client.callTool({
        name: HelperTools.SOME_TOOL,
        arguments: { /* ... */ },
    });
    expect(result.content).toBeDefined();
    await client.close();
});
```

### Manual testing as an MCP client

To test the MCP server, a human must first configure the MCP server.
Once configured, the server exposes tools that become available to the coding agent.

#### 1. Human setup (required before testing)

1. **Configure the MCP server** in your environment (e.g., Claude code, VS Code, Cursor)
2. **Verify connection**: The client should connect and list available tools automatically
3. **Tools are now available**: Once connected, all MCP tools are exposed and ready to use

#### 2. Coding agent for MCP server testing

**Note**: Only execute the tests when explicitly requested by the user.

Once the MCP server is configured, test the MCP tools by:

1. **Invoke each tool** through the MCP client (e.g., ask the AI agent to "search for actors" or "fetch actor details for apify/rag-web-browser")
2. **Test with valid inputs** (happy path) – verify outputs match expected formats
3. **Test with invalid inputs** (edge cases) – verify error messages are clear and helpful
4. **Verify key behaviors**:
   - All tools return helpful error messages with suggestions
   - **get-actor-output** supports field filtering using dot notation
   - Search tools support pagination with `limit` and `offset`

**Tools to test:**
- **search-actors** - Search Apify Store (test: valid keywords, empty keywords, non-existent platforms)
- **fetch-actor-details** - Get Actor info (test: valid actor, non-existent actor)
- **call-actor** - Execute Actor with input
- **get-actor-output** - Retrieve Actor results (test: valid datasetId, field filtering, non-existent dataset)
- **search-apify-docs** - Search documentation (test: relevant terms, non-existent topics)
- **fetch-apify-docs** - Fetch doc page (test: valid URL, non-existent page)

## Coding guidelines

### Indentation

We use **4 spaces** for indentation (configured in `.editorconfig`).

### Naming conventions

- **Constants**: Use uppercase `SNAKE_CASE` for global, immutable constants (e.g., `ACTOR_MAX_MEMORY_MBYTES`, `SERVER_NAME`)
- **Functions & Variables**: Use `camelCase` format (e.g., `fetchActorDetails`, `actorClient`)
- **Classes, Types, Interfaces**: Use `PascalCase` format (e.g., `ActorsMcpServer`, `ActorDetailsResult`)
- **Files & Folders**: Use lowercase `snake_case` format (e.g., `actor_details.ts`, `key_value_store.ts`)
- **Booleans**: Prefix with `is`, `has`, or `should` (e.g., `isValid`, `hasFinished`, `shouldRetry`)
- **Units**: Suffix with the unit of measure (e.g., `intervalMillis`, `maxMemoryBytes`)
- **Date/Time**: Suffix with `At` (e.g., `createdAt`, `updatedAt`)
- **Zod Validators**: Suffix with `Validator` (e.g., `InputValidator`)

### Types and interfaces

- Prefer `type` for flexibility.
- Use `interface` only when it's required for class implementations (`implements`).

### Types organization

- **Centralize shared/public types**: Put cross-module domain types and public API types in `src/types.ts`.
- **Co-locate local types**: Keep module- or feature-specific types next to their usage (in the same file or a local `types.ts`).
- **Use a folder-level `types.ts`** when multiple files in a folder share types, instead of inflating the root `src/types.ts`.

### Comments

- Use JSDoc style comments (`/** */`) for functions, interfaces, enums, and classes
- Use `//` for generic inline comments
- Avoid `/* */` multiline comments (single asterisk)
- Use proper English (spelling, grammar, punctuation, capitalization)

### Code structure

- **Avoid `else`**: Return early to reduce indentation and keep logic flat
- **Keep functions small**: Small, focused functions are easier to understand and test
- **Minimal parameters**: Functions should only accept what they actually use
  - Use comma-separated parameters for up to three parameters
  - Use a single object parameter for more than three parameters
- **Declare variables close to use**: Variables should be declared near their first use
- **Extract reusable logic**: Extract complex or reusable logic into named helper functions
- **Avoid intermediate variables for single-use expressions**: Don't create constants or variables if they're only used once. Inline them directly. For example:
  - ❌ Don't: `const docSourceEnum = z.enum([...]); const schema = z.object({ docSource: docSourceEnum })`
  - ✅ Do: `const schema = z.object({ docSource: z.enum([...]) })`
  - Exception: Only create intermediate variables if they improve readability for complex expressions or serve a documentation purpose

### Async functions

- Use `async` and `await` over `Promise` and `then` calls
- Use `await` when you care about the Promise result or exceptions
- Use `void` when you don't need to wait for the Promise (fire-and-forget)
- Use `return await` when returning Promises to preserve accurate stack traces

### Imports and import ordering

- Imports are automatically ordered and grouped by ESLint:
  - Groups: builtin → external → parent/sibling → index → object
  - Alphabetized within groups
  - Newlines between groups
- Use `import type` for type-only imports
- Do not duplicate imports – always reuse existing imports if present
- Do not use dynamic imports unless explicitly told to do so

### Error handling

- **User errors**: Use appropriate error codes (4xx for client errors), log as `softFail`
- **Internal errors**: Use appropriate error codes (5xx for server errors), log with `log.exception` or `log.error`
- Always handle and propagate errors clearly
- Use custom error classes from `src/errors.ts` when appropriate
- **Don't log then throw**: Do NOT call `log.error()` immediately before throwing. Errors are already logged by the caller or error handler. This creates duplicate logs and violates separation of concerns.
  - ❌ Don't:
    ```typescript
    if (!indexConfig) {
        const error = `Unknown documentation source: ${docSource}`;
        log.error(`[Algolia] ${error}`);
        throw new Error(error);
    }
    ```
  - ✅ Do:
    ```typescript
    if (!indexConfig) {
        throw new Error(`Unknown documentation source: ${docSource}`);
    }
    ```

### Code quality

- All files must follow ESLint rules (run `npm run lint` before committing)
- Prefer readability over micro-optimizations
- Avoid mutating function parameters (use immutability when possible)
- If mutation is necessary, clearly document and explain it with a comment
- Clean up temporary files, scripts, or helper files created during development

### Common patterns

- **Tool implementation**: Tools are defined in `src/tools/` using Zod schemas for validation
- **Actor interaction**: Use `src/utils/apify-client.ts` for Apify API calls, never call Apify API directly
- **Error responses**: Return user-friendly error messages with suggestions
- **Input validation**: Always validate tool inputs with Zod before processing
- **Caching**: Use TTL-based caching for Actor schemas and details (see `src/utils/ttl-lru.ts`)
- **Constants and Tool Names**: Always use constants and never magic or hardcoded values. When referring to tools, ALWAYS use the `HelperTools` enum.
  - **Exception**: Integration tests (`tests/integration/`) must use hardcoded strings for tool names. This ensures tests fail if a tool is renamed, helping to prevent accidental breaking changes.

### Input validation best practices

- **No double validation**: When using Zod schemas with AJV validation (`ajvValidate` in tool definitions), do NOT add additional manual validation checks in the tool implementation. The Zod schema and AJV both validate inputs before the tool is executed. Any checks redundant to the schema definition should be removed.
  - ❌ Don't: Define enum validation in Zod, then manually check the enum again in the tool function
  - ✅ Do: Let Zod and AJV handle all validation; use the parsed data directly in the tool implementation

### Anti-patterns

- **Don't** call Apify API directly – always use the Apify client utilities
- **Don't** mutate function parameters without clear documentation
- **Don't** skip input validation – all tool inputs must be validated with Zod
- **Don't** use `Promise.then()` - prefer `async/await`
- **Don't** create tools without proper error handling and user-friendly messages


### Design System Compliance (MANDATORY)

**READ FIRST**: [DESIGN_SYSTEM_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md](DESIGN_SYSTEM_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md) - Complete design system rules

**Quick Rules** (Zero tolerance):
- ✅ ALWAYS use `theme.*` tokens (colors, spacing)
- ❌ NEVER hardcode: `#hex`, `rgb()`, `Npx` values, font sizes
- ✅ Import from `@apify/ui-library` only
- ✅ Check `mcp__storybook__*` and `mcp__figma__*` availability before UI work
- ✅ Call `mcp__storybook__get-ui-building-instructions` first
- ✅ Read 1-3 similar components for patterns (max 3 files)
- ✅ Verify zero hardcoded values before submitting

**Figma Integration**: Call `mcp__figma__get_design_context` when working from designs.

### What NOT to do (beyond code)

- Don't add features not in the requirements
- Don't refactor working code unless asked
- Don't add error handling for impossible scenarios
- Don't create abstractions for one-time operations
- Don't optimize prematurely
- Don't add configuration for things that won't change
- Don't suggest "improvements" outside current task scope

## External dependencies

### Important relationship: apify-mcp-server-internal

**IMPORTANT**: This package (`@apify/actors-mcp-server`) is imported and used in the private repository `~/apify/apify-mcp-server-internal` for the hosted server implementation.

**Key points:**
- Changes to this repository may affect the hosted server
- Breaking changes must be coordinated between both repositories
- The hosted server uses this package as a dependency
- Canary releases can be created using the `beta` tag on PR branches (see README.md)

**Before making changes:**
- Consider the impact on the hosted server
- Test changes locally before submitting PRs
- Coordinate breaking changes with the team
- Check if changes require updates in `apify-mcp-server-internal`

**Using pkg.pr.new for cross-repo testing:**

PRs with the `beta` label automatically publish a preview package to [pkg.pr.new](https://pkg.pr.new). The internal repo can install it to verify compatibility before the core PR is merged:

```bash
# In apify-mcp-server-internal:
npm i https://pkg.pr.new/apify/apify-mcp-server/@apify/actors-mcp-server@<PR_NUMBER>
npm run type-check && npm run lint

# After core PR merges and releases, restore:
npm install @apify/actors-mcp-server@^<RELEASED_VERSION>
```
